## Components Overview
**App.jsx**
=> The main component that initializes tasks from local storage and manages state. It integrates all major components (CreateTask, ListTasks) and provides drag-and-drop backend support.

**CreateTask.jsx**
=> A form component that enables users to create new tasks with unique IDs, validates task names, and displays notifications on successful creation or validation errors.

## ListTasks.jsx
=> Organizes tasks based on their status ("Todo", "In Progress", "Complete") and maps them to their respective sections. Tasks can be dragged between sections to update their status, with each change saved to local storage.

## Section.jsx
=> A helper component within ListTasks.jsx that represents each section (Todo, In Progress, Complete) and handles the dropping of tasks to update status.

## Header.jsx
=> Displays the title and task count for each section, dynamically styled based on the section status.

## SingleTask.jsx
=> Renders individual tasks, enabling dragging, and includes a button for task deletion.
